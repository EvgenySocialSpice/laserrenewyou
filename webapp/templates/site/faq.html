        <h3>Is laser treatment dangerous?</h3>
        <div class="week-days">
            We all have a current method of removing hair, whether it's shaving, plucking or waxing. Waxing, plucking
            and shaving is quick and not expensive, however these options are only temporary solutions. This is why many
            people choose to go with the path of laser hair removal. Frequent physical friction given to the skin
            through shaving and waxing can cause some to experience skin irritations, flaking and sensitivity. Laser
            treatment treats the skin with a lot more care. Laser therapy uses an intense bean of light to remove hair
            through a process which is known as photothermolysis. The heat of the laser is absorbed by the hair root
            causing the follicle to corrupt. This stops future hair growth. The darker your hair, the more light is
            absorbed, which means - the more effective the hair removal will be. In general, laser hair removal is known
            not to be as effective for those with white or grey hair as very little light is absorbed. All other
            treatments work in a similar way. The risks of using laser treatment involve temporary potential damage to
            the skin that surrounds hair follicles. Common symptoms include skin irritation such as redness, swelling or
            mild pain. Sometimes the laser can lighten or darken the skin and in very rare instances the laser can cause
            scarring or blistering. But you really have to be unlucky to experience either of these, and this is why
            it's also important to choose the laser treatment salon that you trust. If you are concerned about the
            possibility of skin damage or if you have ever had issues with scarring, tell the technicians so they can
            adjust the settings on the laser accordingly to minimize the risks.

        <h3>What can laser treatment do?</h3>
        <div class="week-days">
            Laser treatments are truly like magicians. With laser treatments you can remove hair semi-permanently (from
            anywhere and everywhere on the body), remove permanent tattoos, remove wrinkles, tighten the skin,
            rejuvenate the skin and act as a breast lift assistant.

        <h3>How many sessions do I need to see a result?</h3>
        <div class="week-days">
            Because hair is always growing in different stages and skin cells regenerate, multiple laser treatments are
            often needed. On average, it can take anywhere from four to eight treatments to fully see the result. Some
            lucky individuals see a result after one session! Although laser hair removal is touted as a permanent
            option, it is not guaranteed, and you may need occasional touch-up treatments. There are thousands of people
            all around the world who have made use of laser therapy for various treatments and have been left absolutely
            happy!

        <h3>Is the treatment painful?</h3>
        <div class="week-days">
            The degree of pain that you feel during a treatment will depend on the type of treatment you have chosen and
            the amount of treatment you undergo. In many cases, the degree of pain that is felt is compared to a rubber
            band snapping against your skin. During laser treatment, a topical anesthesia is sometimes applied with
            sedation, especially when treating specific areas of the face. You will be awake yet relaxed, feeling
            minimal discomfort. Other laser skin procedures can be pain-free for some patients, while others experience
            varying degrees of light discomfort. Much of this depends on the sensitivity of your skin itself.

        <h3>How often can I have laser treatment sessions?</h3>
        <div class="week-days">
            Traditionally, having your treatments 4-6 weeks apart is ideal - this gives the treatment a higher chance of
            reaching all of the skin cells / hair follicles.

        <h3>Is laser treatment permanent?</h3>
        <div class="week-days">
            Our machine removes hair permanently. This means that you might have to return for touch up's every 6-8
            months (depending on your hair growth, your hair might not even grow back at all). Our bodies are not like
            machines, they are so delicate - therefore there is no rule-book to how your hair follicles will regenerate
            (if they even will at all).
